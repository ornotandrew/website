I have never been the kind of person who actively posts on social media. In
fact, if you were to look through my Facebook/Twitter timelines right now, you
would find a bursting collection of “not much”.

This is just *who I am*. I have always preferred to consume writing rather than
generate it. I spend a healthy amount of time reading books, and an unhealthy
amount of time sifting through Hacker News and Reddit. So, starting a “blog” is
certainly unusual for me.

## Then why?

Recently, I’ve found myself thinking about something specific, and wanting to
record it somewhere. Not for other people to read, but rather to help get my
thoughts in order and maintain an archive, in case I need to come back to that
train of thought in the future. At first I looked into note-taking tools like
Evernote, but ended up leaning towards keeping my own set of markdown files.
That became a Jekyll blog hosted with Github ages, which in turn led me here. I
see this as an opportunity for me to organize my thoughts, and take stock of
lessons I’ve learned in an open way. If people read what I post — great. If
they don’t — at least I will.

I don’t have a particular plan for what I’ll be writing, but it will likely
involve

* **Programming environments** — Mostly Vim, but also general workflows inside
  a terminal

* **Tooling around programming for the cloud** — Specifically CI/CD, Docker and
  Google Cloud Platform

There will be code snippets. There will be diagrams. There will be opinions.
